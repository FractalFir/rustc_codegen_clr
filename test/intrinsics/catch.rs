    // performance. We can only pass pointers down to `do_call` (can't pass
    // objects by value), so we do all the ownership tracking here manually
    // using a union.
    //
    // We go through a transition where:
    //
    // * First, we set the data field `f` to be the argumentless closure that we're going to call.
    // * When we make the function call, the `do_call` function below, we take
    //   ownership of the function pointer. At this point the `data` union is
    //   entirely uninitialized.
    // * If the closure successfully returns, we write the return value into the
    //   data's return slot (field `r`).
    // * If the closure panics (`do_catch` below), we write the panic payload into field `p`.
    // * Finally, when we come back out of the `try` intrinsic we're
    //   in one of two states:
    //
    //      1. The closure didn't panic, in which case the return value was
    //         filled in. We move it out of `data.r` and return it.
    //      2. The closure panicked, in which case the panic payload was
    //         filled in. We move it out of `data.p` and return it.
    //
    // Once we stack all that together we should have the "most efficient'
    // method of calling a catch panic whilst juggling ownership.
